# Ultrapowa-SC-Editor
Ultrapowa SC Editor is a GUI to read and edit SC files (*.sc) from Supercell games.

This is a fork of the Ultrapowa's Ultrapowa-SC-Editor and can read but not write the latest format.
However I hacked those features in, so its not very clean at the moment but I'll eventually clean it up. ;]

Note: the current version may not run properly since I haven't worked on it for a while.
Also, the app functional design is bad. The editor should not store unpacked files in memory, but should rather dump them on disk to avoid any performance or corruption issue. Save function should repack files from disk. Feel free to enhance it!
